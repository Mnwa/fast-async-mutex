The fast async mutex which uses atomics with spinlock algorithm. 
Spinlock algorithm integrated with the Rust futures concept without the overhead of any libs. Also when the `MutexGuard` is dropped,
a waker of the next locker will be executed.
It will be works with any async runtime in `Rust`, it may be a `tokio`, `smol`, `async-std` and etc..


## Examples

```rust
use fast_async_mutex::mutex::Mutex;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let mutex = Mutex::new(10);
    let guard = mutex.lock().await;
    assert_eq!(*guard, 10);
}
```
